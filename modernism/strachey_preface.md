PREFACE  
=======  
THE history of the Victorian Age will never be written : we  
know too much about it. For ignorance is the first requisite  
of the historian---ignorance, which simplifies and clarifies,  
which selects and omits, with a placid perfection unattainable  
by the highest art. Concerning the Age which has just passed,  
our fathers and our grandfathers have poured forth and  
accumulated so vast a quantity of information that the industry  
of a Ranke would be submerged by it, and the perspicacity of  
a Gibbon would quail before it. It is not by the direct method  
of a scrupulous narration that the explorer of the past can  
hope to depict that singular epoch. If he is wise, he will adopt  
a subtler strategy. He will attack his subject in unexpected  
places; he will fall upon the flank, or the rear; he will shoot a  
sudden, revealing searchlight into obscure recesses, hitherto  
undivined. He will row out over that great ocean of material,  
and lower down into it, here and there, a little bucket, which  
will bring up to the light of day some characteristic specimen,  
from those far depths, to be examined with a careful curiosity.  
Guided by these considerations, I have written the ensuing  
studies. I have attempted, through the medium of biography,  
to present some Victorian visions to the modern eye. They  
are, in one sense, haphazard visions---that is to say, my choice  
of subjects has been determined by no desire to construct a  
system or to prove a theory, but by simple motives of convenience  
and of art. It has been my purpose to illustrate rather  
than to explain. It would have been futile to hope to tell even  

[viii]  
a *précis* of the truth about the Victorian age, for the shortest  
*précis* must fill innumerable volumes. But, in the lives of an  
ecclesiastic, an educational authority, a woman of action, and a  
man of adventure, I have sought to examine and elucidate  
certain fragments of the truth which took my fancy and lay to  
my hand.  

I hope, however, that the following pages may prove to be  
of interest from the strictly biographical no less than from the  
historical point of view. Human beings are too important to  
be treated as mere symptoms of the past. They have a value  
which is independent of any temporal process---which is  
eternal, and must be felt for its own sake. The art of  
biography seems to have fallen on evil times in England. We  
have had, it is true, a few masterpieces, but we have never had,  
like the French, a great biographical tradition; we have had  
no Fontenelles and Condorcets, with their incomparable *éloges*,  
compressing into a few shining pages the manifold existences of  
men. With us, the most delicate and humane of all the  
branches of the art of writing has been relegated to the  
journeymen of letters ; we do not reflect that it is perhaps as  
difficult to write a good life as to live one. Those two fat  
volumes, with which it is our custom to commemorate the  
dead---who does not know them, with their ill-digested masses  
of material, their slipshod style, their tone of tedious panegyric,  
their lamentable lack of selection, of detachment, of design?  
They are as familiar as the *cortège* of the undertaker, and wear  
the same air of slow, funereal barbarism. One is tempted to  
suppose, of some of them, that they were composed by that  
functionary, as the final item of his job. The studies in this  
book are indebted, in more ways than one, to such works---  
works which certainly deserve the name of Standard Biographies.  
For they have provided me not only with much indispensable  
information, but with something even more precious---an  
example. How many lessons are to be learnt from them! But  
it is hardly necessary to particularise. To preserve, for instance,  
a becoming brevity---a brevity which excludes every thing that  
is redundant and nothing that is significant---that, surely, is  

[ix]  
the first duty of the biographer. The second, no less surely, is  
to maintain his own freedom of spirit. It is not his business to  
be complimentary ; it is his business to lay bare the facts of the  
case, as he understands them. That is what I have aimed at  
in this book---to lay bare the facts of some cases, as I under·  
stand them, dispassionately, impartially, and without ulterior  
intentions. To quote the words of a Master---"Je n'impose  
rien ; je ne propose rien ; j'expose."  

*A list of the principal sources from which I have drawn is*  
*appended to each Biography. I would indicate, as an honourable*  
*exception to the current commodity, Sir Edward Cook's excellent*  
*''Life of Florence Nightingale,'' without which my own study,*  
*though composed on a very different scale and from a decidedly*  
*different angle, could not have been written.*
